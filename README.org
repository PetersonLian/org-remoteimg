* org-remoteimg
Display remote images inline, with automatic caching.

** About
This feature is present in Doom Emacs (without the caching), and when I switched to GNU emacs, I found that I had quite liked that feature, so I made it here. You can finally do ~[[https://gaodean.me/gen/cat.jpg]]~, and have it display inline just like local images.

(this image would display in emacs with the plugin enabled)
