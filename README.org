* org-remoteimg
Display remote inline images in org-mode, with automatic caching.

** About
This feature is present in Doom Emacs, and when I switched to GNU emacs, I found that I had quite liked that feature, so I made it here. You can finally do ~[[https://gaodean.me/gen/cat.jpg]]~, and have it display inline just like local images. The code here is mostly from the Doom Emacs codebase, and I just thought to make a small plugin to make it simpler to use for GNU emacs users.

(this image would display in emacs with the plugin enabled)

** Install
After the install, remember to do:
#+begin_src elisp
(setq org-display-remote-inline-images 'cache)
#+end_src

*** use-package
#+begin_src elisp
  (use-package org-remoteimg
    :straight (org-remoteimg :type git :host github :repo "gaoDean/org-remoteimg"))
#+end_src

*** Manual
#+begin_src elisp
  (add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/plugin/")
  (require 'org-remoteimg)
#+end_src

** Caching
This is not present in Doom Emacs by default, or this plugin. If you want automatic caching for either, setup these two variables:
#+begin_src elisp
  (setq url-automatic-caching t)
  (setq url-cache-directory "/path/to/cache/") ;; optional
#+end_src

** Other
This plugin works quite well with [[https://gaoDean/org-imgtog][org-imgtog]]. Remember to do caching if you want to use it though, otherwise you'll have a bad time.
